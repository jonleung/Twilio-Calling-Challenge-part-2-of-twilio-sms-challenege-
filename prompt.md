#### Mission Objective

- Your class is made of 2-person squadrons that are at the gates of Hades.
- Cerberus is guarding the entrance.
- Before you can all pass, you must appease Cerberus by doing the following:
- You only have a finite amount of time

#### Step 1
To request passage, you must call Cerberus on his cell phone number `610-761-0083` and do the following:

- Say over the phone `"I am squadron SQUADRON_NAME and I request safe passage."`
- Play your favorite song over the phone.

He will ONLY accept calls from the number `484-685-0584`.

*Hints*:

- Use Google to figure out how to do this. Yup, it's going to be hard!
- You can use `https://mp3skull.to` to easily find `.mp3` files

#### Step 2:

Before the next step will work, ***each and every squadron***, must have played a song to Cerberus. Help your teammates with step 1 so you can all move to step 3!


#### Step 3:
- Each squadron has a fragment of an incantation.
- Each fragment is numbered.
- If you piece all of the fragments together based on their number, this will yield the full incantation.
- In order for Cerberus to grant passage, the full incantation must be read over the phone to Cerberus in order (with the same constraints as step 1).
- No other squadron can know the other squadron's incantation fragment or else both squadrons will burst into flames. (The incantation is too powerful!!!)
- If the incantations are read to Cerberus out of order, you must start over by starting with the first incantation fragment.
